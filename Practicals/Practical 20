##Practical – 20

Git Repository Setup and Website Deployment

##Aim
To initialize a Git repository, commit and push project files to GitHub, and deploy a personal portfolio website using GitHub Pages or Netlify.

##Software / Tools Required

•Git

•GitHub Account

•Web Browser

•Code Editor (VS Code)

##Theory

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code.

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories.

GitHub Pages and Netlify are platforms used to deploy static websites online.

##Procedure

Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

Open terminal inside the project folder and run:

git init

Step 2: Check Repository Status

git status

Step 3: Add Files to Staging Area

git add .

Step 4: Commit Changes

git commit -m "Initial commit"

Step 5: Create GitHub Repository

Login to GitHub

Click New Repository

Enter repository name (example: portfolio-site)

Click Create Repository

Step 6: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/portfolio-site.git

Step 7: Push Code to GitHub

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main

##Deployment

Method 1: Deploy Using GitHub Pages

Open GitHub repository

Go to Settings → Pages

Select branch main

Click Save

Website URL will be generated as:

Copy code

https://username.github.io/portfolio-site/

##Result

The Git repository was successfully initialized, committed, pushed to GitHub, and the personal portfolio website was successfully deployed online.

##Conclusion

This practical demonstrates the use of Git for version control and GitHub/Netlify for hosting and deploying static websites efficiently.
